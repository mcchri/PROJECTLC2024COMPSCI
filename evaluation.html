    <h1>Evaluation</h1>
    <p><h3>Overall, I am not fully satisfied with the result of this project. There are zero errors with running the circuit game but there are some errors with retrieving data from the Firebase as I needed to correspond with the user's age and the user's memory but they were in different nodes. So the code wasn't the best because I had to manually code constants into the code to match the database.
           The graphs are not the best because it is hard to see the correlation between the digital and analog inputs between the memory score but only the level and score are proportional to the memory score because the memory score is made by multiplying the score and the level. It did achieve the basic and advanced requirements but I wanted a more scientific approach to the forecast prediction.
           Yes, it did forecast the memory percentage compared to your age group but I wanted it to show the time of the attention span and not how age and light affect it furthermore I couldn't take time as a proper input or output so that was one of the reasons why I couldn't do what I wanted to achieve. 
           I am happy with how the Micro bit game turned out because it is a fun and interactive game that anyone can play but it is meant for ages 12 to 18 to improve attention span, my 6-year-old sister was able to play the game because I included universal designs for the symbol and its easy concept was easy to grasp. 
           If I were to do it again I would plan out how I was going to do my whole project more effectively. If I would iterate further with my project I would have the time interval between the patterns appearing increase because then it would definitely test the attention span and improve the user's attention span as well.
