        <p><h2>What connection exists between computer science and well-being?</h2>
        <br /> <h3>Computer science can be implemented with health and mental-being in many ways for example how Fitbits are used to count the steps or how some apps on our phones
            increase our health. The health factors include regular exercise, nutritional diet, enough sleep, self-esteem, achieving goals, and mental clarity. I researched different
            systems that were related to well-being and improving the brain. Apps Lumosity (improves memory by playing games), MindNode (helps to brainstorm), and Cognifit (helps to develop the brain).
            I chose a system that correlates with Lumosity because it is a game on the LED screen of the micro:bit that helps to improve memorization. I rejected the other systems due to their complexity.
    </h3></p><br />
        <h2>My chosen system</h2><br />
        <h3>My idea is a recognizable game called 'Bop It!', which prioritizes how well you can memorize certain patterns. My idea is much more simple because there are only 4 patterns to memorize.
            Here are the following patterns.

        </h3><br />
        <!--Place 4 images of the pattern here-->
        <br /><h3>The game shows one pattern and disappears, the user has to click a button for that pattern and then the number of patterns increases if the player gets the sequence right but if the player gets it wrong they lose the game and restart to one pattern.
            The code will be written on the micro:bit website and combined with Python to send the information to Firebase. The micro:bit code is delivered to the micro:bit via the cable and the pattern output is shown on the LED screen.
            There are two LEDs, one green and one red to signify if the player got the sequence correct or wrong. This game is targeted at all audiences because nowadays a lot of people of all ages have low attention spans.
        </h3>
        <h2>Objectives</h2><br />
        <h3>Basic Requirements:</h3><br />
        <h3>My pattern game is fully automated due to the program running in the micro:bit and the data being sent to the firebase automatically by Python.
            There are 4 buttons which are analogue inputs. I will have a website that displays a graph of all my data using Javascript.
            The game will be played 5 times and from that data, I can predict how much the player has increased their attention span using Python code.
        </h3><br />
        <h3>Advanced Requirements:</h3><br />
        <h3>My 2 what-if questions are: 1. What if the length of time of how long the pattern is shown affects how well the player can memorize the sequence?
            2. What if the age of the player can influence how well they can perform memorizing the sequence?
        </h3>
