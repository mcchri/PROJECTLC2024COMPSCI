    <p><h2>The game</h2></p>
    <p><h3>
    The memory game is codded into the microbit. The inputs are the buttons. To start the game, button A must be pressed.
    There are four patterns to be memorized. The game starts by showing level 1 and then one pattern, if the user pushes the right button 
    then the game shows level 2 on the LED and then shows the previous pattern plus a new one. The levels and the amount of patterns keeps incruementing until 
    the user presses the wrong pattern for the following stored pattern sequence. Here is a flow chart diagram explaining how the game works.

    <p><h3>
    A score is initialised at the start and is increased every time when the correct button is pressed. When the wrong button is pushed the score is sent out to
    python.

    This is the on start function and it initialise the number of LEDs and the serial port.

    <p><h3>
    When the start button A is pressed it shows level 1, creates an empty array for the patterns
    , initialises the level to 1 and calls the game function to start the game. 
    </h3></p>

    <p><h3>
    The function initialises an iterator that will go through every pattern of the sequence.
    After it will call a function to build the patterns based on how many levels there are. 
    Another function will display all the LEDs based on the pattern sequence built by the pattern function.
