    <p><h2>The game</h2></p>
    <p><h3>
    The memory game is codded into the microbit. The inputs are the buttons. To start the game, button A must be pressed.
    There are four patterns to be memorized. The game starts by showing level 1 and then one pattern, if the user pushes the right button 
    then the game shows level 2 on the LED and then shows the previous pattern plus a new one. The levels and the amount of patterns keeps incrementing until 
    the user presses the wrong pattern for the following stored pattern sequence. Here is a flow chart diagram explaining how the game works.
    My analog input is the light sensor and my digital input are the buttons. My analog output is the sound coming from the microbit, if you get the  sequence correct
    a nice sound will play, if incorrect an unhappy noise will play. My digital outputs are the LEDs on the microbit displaying the numbers and text for the game.

    <p><h3>   
    The game starts by the user entering their age by them pressing button A and then outputs the text "age" also age = 0.
    If the button A is pressed the age increases by 10, if button B ia pressed the age will increase by one and 
    if pin 0 is pressed then it the user will choose the level of the game (how fast the images will appear on the LED screen).

    <p><h3>If button B is pressed the level increases by one, if the level is equal to 3 and the button B is pressed then the 
        level is equal to 1. If pin 0 is pressed then record the current light level (ANALOG INPUT). Output the text "level 1", initialise <thead></thead>
