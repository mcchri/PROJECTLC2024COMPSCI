    <p><h1>Plan and design</h1></p>
    
     <p><h3>
    I chose the Agile method on making my project because it is very flexible and suits my requirements.
    </p></h3> 
    
     <p><h3>
    Universal design concepts can be seen with the game and the website. The simple understood button symbols.
    </p></h3> 
        <h2><i>Basic Requirements:</i></h2><br />
        <h3>My system is fully automated, with data sent automatically to Firebase from the microbit and being sent to javascript to automatically create a graph.</h3>
        <br />
        <h2><i>Advanced Requirements:</i></h2><br />
        <h3>A dataset of wellbeing data, including user age, memory score, and light level,
            was created and a Python program was developed to compare memory scores across age groups.
            Graphically presenting with a graph. </h3>
        <h2>Model</h2>
        <h3>My model is a feedback model, it gives back feedback for the user and helps the user to understand what state of mental well-being they are in.</h3>
        <h3><u><i>My 2 what-if questions are:</i></u>
            <ol>
            <li>What if the age affects how well the player can memorize the sequence?
                The three validated parameters are user reading books, user under 18,
                and average age of total game players, which correlate with mental age.  </li>
            <br>
            <li>What if the light intensity affects how well the player can memorize the sequence?The three validated parameters, location, sufficient light source, and average light intensity,
                are crucial in understanding how the environment impacts thinking and well-being.<br>
            </ol>  
    <p><h2>The game</h2></p>
    <p><h3>
        The microbit memory game uses four patterns for memorization,
        with levels and pattern count increasing until incorrect input is made.
        Inputs include light sensor (analog), buttons (digital), sound(analog), and LEDs(digital).
    </p></h3>

    <h2>The age input:</h2>
    <p><h3>   
        The user inputs their age, which is then adjusted by pressing buttons A, B, +10 and +1 respectively.   
    </p></h3>
    <h2>The level input:</h2>
    <p><img src="Screenshot (15).png" alt="Game Diagram" width="30%" height="30%"></p>
    <p><h3>Press button B to increase level, pin 0 to record light level (ANALOG INPUT), output "level 1",
           initialize game level, iterator, and LED list. 
    </h3></p>
    <h2>The LED output:</h2>
    <p><img src="Screenshot (17).png" alt="Game Diagram" width="30%" height="30%"></p>
    <p><h3>
        A random is added to a list representing symbols, and the iterator iterates through the list,
        incrementing each check until the last number is reached.
    </h3></p>
    <h2>The button logic:</h2>
    <p><img src="Screenshot (18).png" alt="Game Diagram" width="30%" height="30%"></p>
    <p><img src="Screenshot (8).png" alt="Game Diagram" width="30%" height="30%"></p>
    <p><img src="Screenshot (9).png" alt="Game Diagram" width="30%" height="30%"></p>
    <p><h3>
     
Initialize an iterator, assign button input values, reset if inputs matches first item,
increment if wrong, output score and light sensitivity, end game with sad noise.
    </h3></p>
    <h2>The architecture of my design and the technologies used:</h2>
    <p><img src="Screenshot (10).png" alt="Game Diagram" width="30%" height="30%"></p>
    <p><h3>
        The microbit recieves the code from the PC in order to execute the game that I made. The light level and the level of the game is send back to the PC. I used pyhton to send my data to 
        the firebase. I retrieved the filtered data with javascript and made a graph using the graph module.
       </h3></p>

    <p><h2>User Requirements:</h2></p>   
    <p><h3>This game boosts the users attention span through memorizing LED patterns and
           enhancing productivity and well-being. Light levels affect memorization effectiveness.
           Ideal for those aiming to improve attention span.
